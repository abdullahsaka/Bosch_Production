## Objective: 
The data for this competition represents measurements of parts as they move through Bosch's production lines. The objective is to predict which parts will fail quality control (represented by a 'Response' = 1).

## Challenge:
It is one of the largest datasets (in terms of number of features) hosted on Kaggle.

## Models: 
I implemented different classification models on manufacturing dataset such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.

## Evaluation Criteria:
Accuracy, Precision and Matthews Correlation Score (MCC).

## Dataset:
